# Tabs Tracker - Browser Extension üñ•Ô∏è

As a developer I constantly find myself with multiple tabs active which definitely has impact on my device (Chrome tabs are memory killers üî™). At the same there are momemts when I log on to youtube and then without even knowing just surfing videos one after other. To tackle such obstacles, I have developed **Tab Tracker** - A powerful browser extension that helps you understand and manage your browsing habits through intuitive visualizations and smart tab management features.
